🎯 Let Me Give You THE Solution:
When You're Stuck, Ask Yourself These Questions:

Question 1: "What am I trying to DO?"
For this exercise:

"I want to detect when the window resizes"

Search: "javascript detect window resize"
Result: You'll find addEventListener('resize')

Question 2: "Has someone done this before?"
Answer: ALWAYS YES!
Every common task has been solved a million times!
Search:

"react hook window size"
"react detect window resize"
"useWindowSize hook"

You'll find: Code examples, explanations, solutions!

Question 3: "What PATTERN does this follow?"
For custom hooks:
Pattern:
1. Create state
2. Create function to update state
3. Set up listener/watcher
4. Return state
Once you recognize the PATTERN, you know what pieces you need!

🎯 Your REAL Learning Strategy:
Don't Try to Memorize - Build a REFERENCE SYSTEM!

Strategy 1: Keep a Personal Code Library
Create a file: my-hooks.md
markdown# My Custom Hooks

## useWindowSize
Detects window size and updates on resize
```javascript
const [width, height] = useWindowSize()
```

## useToggle  
Toggles true/false
```javascript
const [isOn, toggle] = useToggle(false)
```

## useInput
Handles input fields
```javascript
const [value, onChange] = useInput('')
```
```

**Every time you learn something, ADD IT!**

**Next time you need it:** Look in your file! 📚

### **Strategy 2: Pattern Recognition**

**Learn to recognize TYPES of problems:**
```
Problem Type: "I need something to update automatically"
→ Solution Pattern: Event listener or useEffect

Problem Type: "I need to store data"
→ Solution Pattern: useState or localStorage

Problem Type: "I need to do something when component loads"
→ Solution Pattern: useEffect

Problem Type: "I need to repeat code in multiple places"
→ Solution Pattern: Custom hook or function
```

### **Strategy 3: The "I Don't Know" Workflow**

**When you're stuck:**
```
Step 1: Google exactly what you want
"how to [what you want to do] in [technology]"

Examples:
- "how to detect window resize in javascript"
- "how to listen for events in react"
- "how to save data in browser javascript"

Step 2: Read 2-3 results
Look for code examples

Step 3: Try the simplest example
Copy, paste, test

Step 4: Understand it
Read what each line does

Step 5: Add to your notes
Write it in your own words

🎯 For Your Specific Situation:
"I didn't know addEventListener existed"
This is NORMAL! You can't know everything!
What you SHOULD know:

"I need to detect when window resizes" ← The GOAL
"JavaScript probably has a way to do this" ← The ASSUMPTION
"I should search for it" ← The ACTION


🎯 How to Build Your Knowledge Over Time:
Week 1-2: Copy Everything

Google solutions
Copy code
Make it work
Don't worry about understanding 100%

Week 3-4: Understand Patterns

Notice what repeats
See similar structures
Start recognizing patterns

Month 2-3: Modify Solutions

Take examples and change them
Combine different pieces
Create variations

Month 4+: Create from Memory

Remember common patterns
Know where to look for rare stuff
Build confidently


🎯 Practical Exercise Right Now:
Create a file called: react-knowledge.md
Add this:
markdown# React Concepts I've Learned

## Custom Hooks
- Functions that start with `use`
- Can use other hooks inside
- Return values/functions
- Reusable logic

## addEventListener
- Used to listen for browser events
- Syntax: `window.addEventListener('eventName', functionToCall)`
- Common events: 'resize', 'scroll', 'click', 'keypress'

## Window Size
- `window.innerWidth` - get width
- `window.innerHeight` - get height
- Updates when user resizes

## Array Destructuring
- `const [first, second] = array`
- Position matters, names don't
```

**Every time you learn something NEW, add it here!**

## 🎯 **Answer to Your Question:**

> "What can I do in situations with code I've never seen before?"

### **The Answer:**

1. **Google it** - "how to [what you want]"
2. **Read documentation** - MDN for JavaScript, React docs for React
3. **Ask AI** - "How do I detect window resize in React?"
4. **Check examples** - GitHub, CodeSandbox, tutorials
5. **Save it** - Add to your personal notes
6. **Use it** - Practice makes it stick

```
❌ "I should know this" 
✅ "I can find this"

❌ "I forgot this from last month"
✅ "I know where to look it up"

❌ "I'm bad at coding"
✅ "I'm learning new tools"
