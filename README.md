|3.1.2026 | Using disabled = {} inside <select> tag. We can disable it if we need or in case something else is turned on or turned off.
We use 4 states - 2 states for sorting, and two states for filtering, age sort, name sort, gender filter, country filter.
We can use two sorts orders in the same time on the same list, this is impossible because we can have Alin = 50, and Zohar = 20, which will be the first if we have two sorts in the same time, z-a + high - low - this is logically impossible, so we will do only one sort in one tim, the second sord will be unable.
We can use sort with filters together on the same list, this is possible.
We need to save users inside the result variable because we will do the manipulations on the variable and not on the main users list. We set it in let because we will reassign it.
We do result = result.filter we save inside the result the users that we saved in result, now we do on the copies array filter and save it in the same variable result.
We need to make variable by name comparison = 0 we will do later if(comparison === 0){} then we can do a-z sorting
We do manipulations with the comparison in the ages logic sort() we save there the check in the comparison.
