**Topic:** Using disabled = {} inside tag

**Notes:**
- We can disable it if we need or in case something else is turned on or turned off.
- We use 4 states - 2 states for sorting, and two states for filtering, age sort, name sort, gender filter, country filter.
- We can use two sorts orders in the same time on the same list, this is impossible because we can have Alin = 50, and Zohar = 20, which will be the first if we have two sorts in the same time, z-a + high - low - this is logically impossible, so we will do only one sort in one time, the second sort will be unable.
