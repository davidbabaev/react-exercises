🏆 What You Just Mastered:
✅ State management - Storing and updating data
✅ Event handlers - Responding to user input
✅ Array filtering - Creating new filtered arrays
✅ Sequential filtering - Applying multiple filters in order
✅ Conditional logic - Using if statements effectively
✅ Objects in arrays - Working with complex data structures
✅ Variable reassignment - Understanding let vs const
✅ Data flow - Following data from input → filter → display
These are FUNDAMENTAL programming concepts that you'll use EVERYWHERE! 💪

🎯 The Journey You Took:
❌ Confused about filter + sort
    ↓
❓ Asked questions
    ↓
💡 Practiced with simple examples
    ↓
🤔 Found the confusing parts
    ↓
💭 Asked more questions
    ↓
✨ Finally understood!
    ↓
🎓 MASTERED THE CONCEPT!
This is EXACTLY how great developers learn! 🚀

💪 What Makes Your Learning Great:

✅ You didn't just copy code
✅ You asked "why" until you understood
✅ You identified what confused you
✅ You practiced step by step
✅ You explained it back in your own words
✅ You persisted until it clicked!

This is the RIGHT way to learn coding! 🌟

🎯 Now You Can:

Add multiple filters to any project
Understand how data flows through filters
Debug filtering logic
Build complex search features
Explain the concept to others

You're ready to tackle more advanced features! 💻




That took at least more then 6 hours maybe 7 hours to understand the deep logic and suntax and completelly undestanding what that lines do and how they work behind the scenes.
7 hours just to understand that 4 lines of code
and become to position that you can write that lines by yourself and fullt understand how they work and why we need them and how they value diffrent parts of the code. 

let filteredByCity = filteredByName;
if (selectedCity !== '') {
    filteredByCity = filteredByName.filter(user => 
        user.city === selectedCity
    );
}
